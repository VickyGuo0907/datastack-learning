### What is the Modern Data Stack? 
[Reference](https://continual.ai/post/the-future-of-the-modern-data-stack)
The Modern Data Stack commonly refers to a collection of technologies that comprise a cloud-native data platform, generally leveraged to reduce the complexity in running a traditional data platform. The individual components are not fixed, but they typically include: 

* A Cloud Data Warehouse, such as [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/), [Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/pm/redshift), [BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery), or [Databricks Delta Lake](https://databricks.com/product/delta-lake-on-databricks)
* A Data Integration Service, such as [Fivetran](http://fivetran.com/), [Segment](http://segment.com/), or [Airbyte](http://airbyte.io/)
* A ELT data transformation tool, almost certainly [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/)
* A BI layer, such as [Looker](https://looker.com/) or [Mode](http://mode.com/) 
* A Reverse ETL tool, such as [Census](http://getcensus.com/) or [Hightouch](http://hightouch.io/)
